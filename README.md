# Tic Tac Toe 
This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game I made with just HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript.

## Features
- Can be played on 2 different browsers so that 2 players can play it easily
- Keep track of the score
- Reset if you think your opponent is winning a little too much :p
- Saves your play so that you can come back to it anytime
